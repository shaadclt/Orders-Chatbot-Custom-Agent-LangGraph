# 🛒 Laptop Orders Management Agent

An **Agentic chatbot** built using **LangChain**, **Groq Inference Engine (Llama3-70B)**, and **LangGraph**, that manages laptop product orders by interacting with structured tools. 

The agent can retrieve and update laptop order information from a CSV database, handle greetings, and small talk professionally.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

- Connect **Groq's Llama 3 70B model** using `langchain_groq`.
- Load and manage product orders from a CSV file using **Pandas**.
- Build **tools** to:
  - Retrieve order details.
  - Update order quantities.
- Create a **LangGraph agent** that:
  - Switches between LLM calls and tool calls.
  - Maintains conversation history using in-memory checkpointing.
  - Handles user queries in a professional tone with a **custom system prompt**.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```plaintext
├── Laptop Orders.csv        # Sample orders dataset
├── Load model + CSV         # Setup Groq and read CSV into DataFrame
├── Tool Definitions         # get_order_details and update_quantity
├── OrdersAgent Class        # Manages LLM interactions and tool execution
├── Conversation Simulation  # Runs a test chat loop with sample user inputs
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Setup**: Load your Groq API key using `userdata` in Colab.
2. **Tools**: 
   - `get_order_details(order_id)`: Fetch order details by ID.
   - `update_quantity(order_id, new_quantity)`: Update quantity for an order.
3. **Agent**: 
   - Processes user inputs.
   - Decides whether to call an internal tool or respond conversationally.
4. **Memory**: 
   - Maintains chat history across the session using `MemorySaver`.
5. **Chat Simulation**:
   - A sequence of user prompts (small talk + order management) is fed to the agent to test its behavior.

## 🖼️ Agent Graph Visualization

The agent’s flow is visualized using Mermaid diagrams generated by `get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()`.

## 🚀 Running the Project

1. Open the project in **Google Colab**.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain langgraph pandas
   ```
3. Set your Groq API Key in Colab:

  ```python
  from google.colab import userdata
  os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"] = userdata.get("GROQ_API_KEY")
  ```
4. Run each cell sequentially to load models, tools, agent, and simulate conversation.

## 📄 Sample Outputs
**USER**: Please show me the details of the order ORD-7311
**AGENT**: Here are the details: Product Name - Dell XPS 13, Quantity - 2, Delivery Date - 2025-05-01

**USER**: Can you add one more of that laptop to the order?
**AGENT**: Successfully updated the quantity to 3 for Order ID ORD-7311.

**USER**: Bye
**AGENT**: Thank you for reaching out! Have a great day.

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Add support for cancelling or creating new orders.
- Connect to a real-time database instead of a CSV file.
- Deploy the agent as a web app using Streamlit or Gradio.
- Add multi-turn reasoning and tool selection improvements.
